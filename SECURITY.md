# Security Policy — rein

## Supported versions

Rein is pre-1.0 and has not cut a tagged release yet. Security fixes land on
`main`; test against the latest commit and report the SHA you used.

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.** Instead:

1. Open a private [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/GrayCodeAI/rein/security/advisories/new), **or**
2. Email `security@graycodeai.com` with the details below.

Include in your report:

- A description of the vulnerability and the affected component.
- Steps to reproduce, ideally with a minimal proof-of-concept.
- The commit SHA you tested against.
- The potential impact and any suggested mitigation.

**Response targets:**

- Initial acknowledgement: within **48 hours**.
- Triage and severity assessment: within **5 business days**.
- Coordinated fix and disclosure: within **30 days** for high/critical, **90
  days** for medium/low (per industry-standard responsible disclosure).

## Disclosure policy

We follow [coordinated vulnerability disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_vulnerability_disclosure):

- Reporters receive credit in the advisory and `CHANGELOG.md` (unless they opt
  out).
- We ask that reporters refrain from public disclosure until a fix has been
  released or the disclosure deadline above has elapsed.
- We will not pursue legal action against good-faith researchers acting
  within this policy.

## Security practices in this repo

- **Standard library only:** there are no third-party Go dependencies, so the
  dependency surface is limited to the Go toolchain itself.
- **CI checks:** `gofmt`, `go vet`, and `go test -race` run on every push and
  pull request.
- **No secrets required:** the project needs no API keys or credentials, and
  none are stored in the repository.
- **Privacy-safe events:** the event format stores tool names, IDs,
  SHA-256 digests of inputs and outputs, and exit codes. Raw prompts, arguments,
  and output are outside the format.
- **Strict parsing:** unknown JSON fields are rejected, so a malformed or
  expanded event stream fails closed.
- **Host-enforced verdicts:** in `enforce` mode a `deny` exits with status 3.
  The host must honour the verdict before executing the proposed tool call;
  Rein cannot stop a tool on its own.

## Scope

This policy covers the code in this repository and the build artefacts
published from it. It does not cover third-party tools or services, or misuse
by someone who already has shell access to the machine.
